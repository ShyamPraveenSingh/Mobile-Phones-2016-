	 <h1> The Phones can be classified on the basis of their operating system: </em> </br>
	<li> Android <br> <br>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily fortouchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.
Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems (OS) of any kind.[b] Android has been the best selling OS on tablets since 2013, and on smartphones it is dominant by any metric.[15][16]
Initially developed by Android, Inc., which Google bought in 2005,[17] Android was unveiled in 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance – a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancingopen standards for mobile devices.[18] As of July 2013, the Google Play store has had over one million Android applications ("apps") published – including many "business-class apps"[19] that rival competing mobile platforms[20] – and over 50 billion applications downloaded.[21] An April–May 2013 survey of mobile application developers found that 71% of developers create applications for Android,[22] and a 2015 survey found that 40% of full-time professional developers see Android as their priority target platform, which is comparable to Apple's iOS on 37% with both platforms far above others.[23] In September 2015, Android had 1.4 billion monthly active devices.[24]
Android's source code is released by Google under open source licenses, although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software, including proprietary software required for accessing Google services.[3] Android is popular with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices.[25] Its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users[26] or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. The success of Android has made it a target for patent (and copyright) litigation as part of the so-called "smartphone wars" between technology companies. <br> <br> <br>


	<li> iOS <br> <br>iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android by sales. iPad tablets are also the second most popular, by sales, against Android since 2013, when Android tablet sales increased by 127%.[6]
Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone, it has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch(September 2007) and the iPad (January 2010). As of June 2016, Apple's App Store contained more than 2 million iOS applications,[7] 725,000 of which are native for iPads.[8] These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times.[7]
The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internalaccelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode).
Major versions of iOS are released annually. The current version, iOS 10, was released on September 13, 2016.[9] It runs on the iPhone 5 and later, iPad (4th generation) and later, iPad Pro, iPad Mini 2 and later, and the 6th-generation iPod Touch. In iOS, there are four abstraction layers: the Core OS, Core Services, Media, and Cocoa Touch layers. iOS 10 dedicates around 1.8GB of the device's flash memory for itself.[10]


	<li> Windows<br> <br> Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold byMicrosoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) orWindows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.
Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[4] Microsoft Windows came todominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984. Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in 1993). On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system. However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android,[5] because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones. In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold were less than 25% of Android devices sold. This comparisons, however, may not be fully relevant as the two operating systems traditionally targeted different platforms.
As of September 2016, the most recent version of Windows for PCs, tablets, smartphones and embedded devices is Windows 10. The most recent versions for server computers is Windows Server 2016. A specialized version of Windows runs on theXbox One game console.[6]

	<li> Java <br> <br> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless ofcomputer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[17][18][19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensedmost of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
The latest version is Java 8, which is the only version currently supported for free by Oracle, although earlier versions are supported both by Oracle and other companies on a commercial basis.

	<li> Symbian <br> <br>Symbian is a discontinued mobile operating system (OS) and computing platform designed for smartphones.Symbian was originally developed as a closed-source OS for PDAs in 1998 by Symbian Ltd..Symbian OS was a descendant of Psion's EPOC, and runs exclusively on ARM processors, although an unreleased x86 port existed. Symbian was used by many major mobile phone brands, like Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and above all by Nokia. As a pioneer that established the smartphone industry, it was the most popular smartphone OS on a worldwide average until the end of 2010 – at a time when smartphones were in limited use, when it was overtaken by Android, as Google and its partners achieved wide adoption.

Symbian OS was (from 2001) essentially a shell system and required an additional user interface (as middleware) to form a complete operating system. Symbian OS became prominent from the S60 (formerly Series 60) platform built by Nokia, first released in 2002 and powering most Nokia smartphones. Symbian eventually became the most widely used smart mobile operating system. UIQ was another Symbian user interface mostly used by Motorola and Sony Ericsson, whereas in Japan there was also the MOAP platform. Applications of these interfaces were not compatible with each other, despite each being built atop Symbian OS. Nokia was the majority shareholder in Symbian Ltd. and purchased the entire share in 2008.The non-profit Symbian Foundation was then created to make a royalty-free successor to Symbian OS - seeking to unify the platform, S60 became the Foundation's favoured UI and UIQ stopped development. Symbian^1 (or S60 5th Edition) was created as a result in 2009. Symbian^2 was only used by carrier NTT DoCoMo, one of the members of the Foundation, for the Japanese market. Symbian^3 was released as in 2010, by which time it became fully open source. Symbian^3 received the Anna and Belle updates in 2011.

The Symbian Foundation disintegrated in late 2010 and Nokia took back control of the OS development. In February 2011, Nokia, by now the only remaining company still supporting Symbian outside Japan, announced that it would use Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone platform, whilst Symbian would be gradually wound down.Two months later, Nokia moved the OS to closed licensing. and later outsourced Symbian development to Accenture.Although support was promised until 2016, there was little development from Accenture, where most Symbian developers had already left by 2012. In January 2014, Nokia stopped accepting new or changed Symbian software from developers.

The Nokia 808 PureView was officially the last Symbian smartphone from Nokia. However NTT DoCoMo continued releasing OPP(S) (Operator Pack Symbian, successor of MOAP) devices in Japan, which still act as middleware on top of Symbian.[20] Phones running this include the F-07F from Fujitsu and SH-07F from Sharp in 2014.
