<h2> <u> Disadvantages of Mobile Phones </h2> </u>
<pre>
1
Constant Interruption
Since you’re always connected when you have your mobile phone, it becomes harder to ignore interruptions. People are always on their phones receiving calls, checking out their friends on Facebook, chatting on WhatsApp, checking emails and listening to music. It has become virtually impossible to avoid unneeded interruption. If you’re unable to control yourself, this can become a problem as you won’t have time to get anything important done. Furthermore, you can’t avoid work related emails and phone calls when you’re at home with your family or on vacation.
 
2
Possibility of Privacy Leak
Having all your information on your device is very convenient. However, it’s also dangerous because there’s a possibility of someone else accessing your phone. Mobile phone theft is quite common and it could leave you exposed. It is therefore important to secure your phone from unauthorized access. You should also avoid storing sensitive data such as bank and credit card details. It is also possible for someone to hijack your email and social media accounts using your phone for malicious reasons.
 
3
Distraction
The accidents caused by usage of mobile phones when driving is innumerable. The temptation to pick an important call when driving is huge. While you may have done it successfully in the past, it is not a good idea. The distraction could easily cause you to lose control of the car and consequently cause an accident. While it is possible to put your phone on hands free mode, it is usually best to wait until you get to your destination or even pull over in order to pick the call.
The mobile phone can also disrupt a meeting or class if proper etiquette is not followed. The phone ringing during a class or meeting can distract the attendees and waste precious time. Always put your phone in silent mode when you are in such a circumstance.
 
4
Affect Real Interaction
Today, socializing that involves real interaction is very rare. People have been reduced to interacting on social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, or chat applications such as Viber and WhatsApp. While there’s nothing expressly wrong with chatting with your friends on these platforms, it can be a problem if it is done at the expense of face to face interaction. It can easily take you away from the real life activities and you will find it hard interacting with real people. In a family where every family member has a mobile phone and uses it every time they are together, it might cause breakdown of relationships and families.
